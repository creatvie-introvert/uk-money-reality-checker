# UK Money Reality Checker

A simple, judgement-free tool to help people understand **what their salary actually feels like in the UK** after tax and typical everyday costs.

This project focuses on **context, not advice** — helping users reflect on take-home pay, common expenses, and lifestyle trade-offs without sign-ups, accounts, or complex budgeting tools.

## ✨ Purpose

Salary figures are often discussed in gross terms that don’t reflect real life.

The UK Money Reality Checker aims to:

- Translate annual salaries into **monthly take-home context**
- Show **typical UK living costs** using realistic ranges
- Encourage **personal reflection**, not optimisation or judgement
- Remain accessible, fast, and easy to understand

> This tool is **not a financial calculator** and **does not provide financial advice**.
